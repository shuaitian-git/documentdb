# Code of Conduct

**Effective: September 14, 2017**

LF Projects, LLC ("LF Projects") supports and hosts open source and open standards projects (each a "Project") and undertakes such other activities as approved by The Linux Foundation. LF Projects, LLC is a Delaware series limited liability company. Projects of LF Projects are formed as separate series of LF Projects (each, a "Series"). References to "Projects" within this Policy include the applicable Series for each Project.

## Our Pledge

LF Projects hosts communities where participants choose to work together, and in that process experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved informally. In rare cases, however, behavior can intimidate, harass, or otherwise disrupt one or more people in the community, which LF Projects will not tolerate.

A Code of Conduct ("Code") is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice. It also provides a benchmark for self-evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the organization.

## Scope

This Code applies to any participant of any Project â€“ including without limitation developers, participants in meetings, teleconferences, mailing lists, conferences or functions, and contributors. Note that this Code complements rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.

In addition, with the approval of LF Projects, Projects are free to adopt their own code of conduct in place of the Code.

## Our Standards

LF Projects is committed to maintain a positive, professional work environment. This commitment calls for workplaces where participants at all levels behave according to the rules of the following code. A foundational concept of this code is that we all share responsibility for our work environment.

**We expect participants to:**

- Treat each other with respect, professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.
- Never engage in any form of harassment, including but not limited to:
  - **Harassment** is any conduct, verbal or physical, that has the intent or effect of interfering with an individual, or that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.
  - **Sexual harassment** includes visual displays of degrading sexual images, sexually suggestive conduct, offensive remarks of a sexual nature, requests for sexual favors, unwelcome physical contact, and sexual assault.

## Who This Applies To

Anyone from the Public partaking in the LF Projects work environment (e.g. contribute code, comment on our code or specs, email us, attend our conferences, functions, etc.)

## Our Commitment

**Respect** is the genuine consideration you have for someone (if only because of their status as participant in LF Projects, like yourself), and that you show by treating them in a polite and kind way.

**Summary:** if you are unsure whether something might be welcome or unwelcome, don't do it.

## Reporting

To report incidents or to appeal reports of incidents, send email to the Manager of LF Projects, Mike Dolan ([manager@lfprojects.org](mailto:manager@lfprojects.org)). Please include any available relevant information, including links to any publicly accessible material relating to the matter.

Every effort will be taken to ensure a safe and collegial environment in which to collaborate on matters relating to the Project. In order to protect the community, the Project reserves the right to take appropriate action, potentially including the removal of an individual from any and all participation in the project. The Project will work towards an equitable resolution in the event of a misunderstanding.

## Attribution

This code is based on the W3C's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct with some additions from the Cloud Foundry's Code of Conduct and the Hyperledger Project Code of Conduct.
